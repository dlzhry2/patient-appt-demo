Technical improvements:
- implement full e2e tests
- introduce linting and type checking e.g. ruff & mypy
- add docstrings etc.
- add more information to FastAPI routes and pydantic models to improve the generated schema
- unit tests
- (stretch) could add a pre-commit/manual step that copies the generated schema to the location in the repo, as it is nice
to have the openapi.json file in the repository

Features:
- add, check and update appointment functionality (ensure update validation is implemented and timestamp is stored as UTC)
- standardise validation error format and ensure it is documented in Open API schema
- break name into GDS-compliant format
- error message localisation
- database migration tooling e.g. Alembic
